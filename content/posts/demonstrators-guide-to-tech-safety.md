It is important to understand that you are taking these actions not only to protect yourself - but to protect those around you. For example - a single seized phone may lead to the arrest of your entire group chat.

Your actions may be entirely nonviolent, but your presence with the demonstration places you at risk of guilt by association.

## Pre-action

### You:

- Set a strong passcode on your cell phone (make it alphanumberic - PINs can be broken in minutes to hours)
- Completely turn off location services (guides for: [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207092) and [Android](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en))
- Ensure you have plenty of storage available
- Charge your phone fully
- Download map if unfamiliar with area
- Ensure all electronic devices you plan to leave at home (for example, laptop) have full disk encryption turned on, then completely power them off.
  - Learn how to turn on disk encryption on [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) and [PC](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4502379/windows-10-device-encryption).

### Your group:

- Download the [Signal messaging app](https://signal.org)
  - Turn on expiring messages in your conversation and set to time of 30 minutes or less
  - Keep message groups small
- Agree on rendezvous point far from action location. Remember, you won't be able to safely use data at the action.

## On the way to action

- Place phone in Airplane Mode
- Manually turn off WiFi and Bluetooth in Settings app (not quick controls)
- Completely power off any wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc)
- Practice powering off your phone quickly

## At action

### Photography:

- Leave your phone locked while taking photos
- Try to avoid photographing demonstrators' faces. This could place them in danger of being doxxed and attacked later. Yes, [this *does* happen](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/puzzling-number-men-tied-ferguson-protests-have-died-n984261).

### If you are about to be detained:

- ***Turn your phone off completely!***
  - With a strong passcode it will not be possible for law enforcement to access data on your smartphone.
- ***Do NOT consent to the search of your device.***
  - You are NOT required to provide your passcode, even with a search warrant.
  - Under the 5th amendment, your passcode counts as self-incriminating testimony, which you have the right to refuse.

## After action

### Make sure everyone is ok!

- This goes without saying

### Be mindful of what you post

- Blackout faces. Blurs are often reversible with software.
