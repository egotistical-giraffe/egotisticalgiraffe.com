**TOR** stands for **T**he **O**nion **R**outer. It's an anonymization tool built by a dedicated network of volunteers. Or, as Zoz put it, it's how you research catastrophic liver failure without raising your insurance premiums.

(Don't Google Zoz's name with your regular browser unless you want to be put on a list. [Download TOR here](https://torproject.org), then go on Youtube with it and search "Don't fuck it up".)
